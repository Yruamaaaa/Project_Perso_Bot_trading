# Project_Perso_Bot_trading
Following a YouTube tutorial I made a trading bot based on an LLM making decision. And then I tried to increase the profit the bot was making


Project Name: Sentiment-Based Trading Strategy

Description:
This project implements a sentiment-based trading strategy using Python and Alpaca API. Initially inspired by Nicholas Renotte's tutorial on YouTube, modifications have been made to explore new approaches and improve performance.

Tutorial Source: Nicholas Renotte on YouTube

Project Overview:
The project involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Historical stock price data is obtained from Alpaca API.
Sentiment Analysis: News headlines related to the stock are analyzed for sentiment using FinBERT.
Strategy Implementation: MLTrader class is developed to execute buy/sell trades based on sentiment and market conditions.
Backtesting: The strategy is backtested using YahooDataBacktesting to evaluate its performance.
Results:
Results of the backtesting can be found in the log folder, with results from different versions. The first two results are pretty bad, and last one is the last version of the Bot.

Note: This project is for educational and experimental purposes only. Trading involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.
